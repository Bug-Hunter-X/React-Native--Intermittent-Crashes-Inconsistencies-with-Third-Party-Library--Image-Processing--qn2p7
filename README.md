# React Native: Intermittent Crashes/Inconsistencies with Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using a third-party image processing library in a React Native application.  The bug manifests as intermittent crashes or inconsistent state updates under specific conditions (low memory, specific device configurations).  The error is difficult to reproduce consistently and lacks detailed error messages.

## Bug Description:
The application utilizes a third-party library for image manipulation.  In certain scenarios, the library fails to function correctly, resulting in application crashes or unexpected behavior. The issue is not consistently reproducible and does not always generate clear error messages in the console.

## Solution:
The solution involves carefully examining the third-party library's documentation for compatibility issues, checking dependencies and upgrading versions. Using error boundaries to gracefully handle library-related exceptions is crucial. Additional logging may be needed to pinpoint the exact conditions leading to the failure, and defensive coding within the application can help mitigate the issue.
